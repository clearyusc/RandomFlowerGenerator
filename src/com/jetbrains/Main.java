        * This will be version 1.0 of this idea.  It will be only command line.
        * Version 2.0 will be CSS, HTML, JavaScript, AJAX, etc.

        * Design:
        * A guy has a girlfriend/fianc√©e/wife.  He wants to be reminded when to get her flowers (1-2 weeks before a certain date).
        * He also wants the program to tell him 'random' times to get her flowers so that he can be mathematically spontaneous.
        *
        * Input-
        *       Her birthday
        *       Anniversary (dating, wedding, etc.)
        *       Any other important dates (milestones, special moments, etc.)
        *       [Valentine's day will be programmatically captured]
        *
        * Output-
        *       List of dates when he needs to get her flowers for the next 365 days.
